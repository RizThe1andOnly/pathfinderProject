# Pathfinder Project
### Rizwan Chowdhury

Implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm that also contains blocks/obstacles. 

This project is built using ReactJS,HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. The entire project is a React Component. It cannot be run as standalone, as it is in this repository. It can be viewed as part of a ReactJS website.

The project is currently available for demo-ing in my website: https://rizthe1andonly.github.io/riz_site/projects/PathFinder
